    "This short tutorial demonstrates how to run an RNA-Seq workflow using a prokaryotic data set. Steps in the workflow include read trimming, read QC, read mapping, and counting mapped reads per gene to quantitate gene expression. This tutorial uses a popular workflow manager called [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) run via [Google Batch](https://cloud.google.com/batch/docs/get-started). If you completed the other tutorials in this repo, you will see that it is similar to Tutorial 2, but instead of running Snakemake locally, we switch to Nextflow and run it using Batch in a serverless manner.

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Installing and configuring Nextflow:** Learners will install mambaforge (a conda distribution) and Nextflow, a workflow management system, within their Jupyter environment. They will also learn how to configure their `nextflow.config` file to utilize the Google Batch execution environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understanding and modifying a Nextflow pipeline:** The notebook utilizes a pre-existing Nextflow pipeline (`main.nf`).  The objective is to understand how to modify the pipeline's configuration file to point to the correct input data (samplesheet) and output locations within the GCS bucket. This includes setting appropriate parameters for the Google Batch execution (region, project ID, machine type).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Running a Nextflow workflow on Google Batch:**  Learners will submit their configured Nextflow workflow to Google Batch for execution. This involves understanding and utilizing command-line arguments to specify input files, output directory, working directory, and the execution profile.  They'll also learn about the `-resume` option for restarting partially completed workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Analyzing RNA-Seq results:**  The final objective is to analyze the generated RNA-Seq data.  This involves using command-line tools (like `grep` and `sort`) to identify and report the top highly expressed genes and the expression levels of specific genes of interest (e.g., a putative acyl-ACP desaturase)."

    "* **Google Cloud Batch API:**  This is explicitly mentioned in the notebook and is crucial for submitting and managing the Nextflow workflow on Google Batch.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Compute Engine API:**  While not explicitly stated, it's highly likely needed by Google Batch to provision the virtual machines required for the workflow execution.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Storage API:**  This is necessary to interact with Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets for storing input data, intermediate files, and output results.  The notebook uses `gsutil` commands extensively.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Logging API:** (mentioned in the notebook)  Likely used for logging information about the batch job execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Platform Account Roles that must be assigned:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific roles depend on how the user wants to manage resources. However, at minimum, the user needs roles that grant permissions to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storage Object Admin:**  To create, read, write, and delete objects in the GCS bucket.  This role is needed for uploading inputs and storing outputs.  This could be simplified to a more granular role depending on the needs.\n",
    "* **Batch Job User:**   To submit Batch Jobs.  Without this, the user wouldn't be able to execute the workflow on Google Batch. A more granular role might suffice.\n",
    "* **Compute Instance User:**  To allow Batch to provision VMs. This role may be implicitly granted if the Batch user role is sufficiently powerful. A more granular role might suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software Prerequisites (not Cloud-specific):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook:**  The environment to run the notebook itself.\n",
    "* **Nextflow:** The workflow management system used.  The notebook includes instructions for installing it using mambaforge.\n",
    "* **Mambaforge (or Miniconda/Anaconda):**  A package manager for installing Nextflow and its dependencies.\n",
    "* **Docker:**  Docker containers are utilized within the Google Batch jobs."

    "This Jupyter Notebook demonstrated a streamlined RNA-Seq analysis workflow leveraging the power of Nextflow and Google Cloud's Batch API.  The workflow, encompassing read trimming, quality control, mapping, and gene quantification, was executed efficiently in a serverless environment. By utilizing Google Cloud Storage for input and output data, and Google Batch for task orchestration, the notebook showcased a scalable and reproducible approach to RNA-Seq analysis.  The steps detailed the setup, including Google Cloud project configuration and Nextflow installation, followed by the execution of the pipeline and analysis of the resulting gene expression data.  The notebook successfully retrieved and displayed the top 10 most highly expressed genes and demonstrated the analysis of a specific gene of interest, highlighting the practical application of this cloud-based approach for RNA-Seq data processing and interpretation.  This approach offers a robust and scalable solution for researchers needing to efficiently manage computationally intensive RNA-Seq analyses."
