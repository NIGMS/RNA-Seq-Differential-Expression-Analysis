    "This short tutorial demonstrates how to run an RNA-Seq workflow using a prokaryotic data set. Steps in the workflow include read trimming, read QC, read mapping, and counting mapped reads per gene to quantitate gene expression. This tutorial uses a popular workflow manager called [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) run via the [Google Cloud Life Sciences API](https://cloud.google.com/life-sciences/docs/reference/rest). If you completed the other tutorials in this repo, you will see that much of it is a repeat of Tutorial 2, but instead of running Snakemake locally, it uses the Life Sciences API to run in a serverless way. You will need to repeat most of the steps here because this notebook copies the data to a bucket instead of locally.\n",
    "**Make sure you enable the Life Science API before running this tutorial**."

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Snakemake for workflow management:** The notebook demonstrates how to utilize Snakemake to define and execute a bioinformatics workflow in a reproducible and scalable manner.  Learners will understand how to structure a Snakemake workflow (using the provided `snakefile_ls_api`).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Execute Snakemake on Google Cloud Life Sciences API:** The core learning objective focuses on leveraging the Google Cloud Life Sciences API to run a Snakemake pipeline in a serverless environment.  This avoids the need for managing local compute resources.  The steps cover authentication with Google Cloud using service account keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Perform standard RNA-Seq analysis steps:** The workflow encompasses typical RNA-Seq processing steps, including read trimming (Trimmomatic), quality control (FastQC), read mapping (Salmon), and read counting to quantify gene expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpret RNA-Seq results:** The notebook concludes by guiding users through interpreting the generated output, focusing on identifying highly expressed genes and comparing gene expression levels between different samples.  This includes extracting and analyzing data from the Salmon output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Troubleshoot cloud-based pipelines:** The tutorial emphasizes understanding how to access and interpret logs from the Google Cloud Life Sciences API jobs to troubleshoot any pipeline failures."

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**APIs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Life Sciences API:**  This is explicitly stated as a requirement in the notebook.  It's used to run the Snakemake workflow in a serverless manner on Google Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Platform Account Roles:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook requires at least the following roles (or equivalent permissions) to be assigned to the service account used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Storage Object Admin:** This is needed to create, modify and delete objects (files) in Google Cloud Storage buckets.  Many actions in the notebook (like `gsutil` commands) require this level of access.\n",
    "* **Life Sciences User:** This role allows the service account to submit jobs to the Life Sciences API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloud Platform Access:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Project:** A Google Cloud project is essential.  The notebook uses `gcloud` commands which require this project context to be set.\n",
    "* **Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket:** A GCS bucket is created to store input (FASTQ files, reference genomes) and output files generated by the RNA-Seq pipeline. The notebook uses a unique bucket name to avoid conflicts.\n",
    "* **Compute Engine (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, the Life Sciences API relies on Compute Engine resources to execute the workflow's individual steps. Therefore, implicit access to Compute Engine resources within the project is required, even if it's managed automatically by the Life Sciences API.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software and Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python:** The notebook uses Python code to interact with the Google Cloud libraries and manipulate data.\n",
    "* **Mambaforge (or other conda distribution):** Used for managing Python packages and dependencies, specifically installing `snakemake`.\n",
    "* **Snakemake:** The workflow management system orchestrating the RNA-Seq pipeline.\n",
    "* **Git:** Used to initialize a local Git repository (not strictly necessary for the pipeline itself).\n",
    "* **Various bioinformatics tools:** The Snakemake workflow likely depends on several bioinformatics tools (Trimmomatic, Salmon, etc.). These are specified within the Snakefile and its config files, so their specific versions are controlled by the conda environments.\n",
    "* **Service Account Key File (`cloud_creds.json`):**  A JSON key file downloaded from the Google Cloud Console for the service account that will run the Life Sciences API jobs.  This is crucial for authentication."

    "This Jupyter Notebook successfully demonstrated a complete RNA-Seq analysis workflow using Snakemake orchestrated via the Google Cloud Life Sciences API.  The workflow, encompassing read trimming, quality control, mapping, and quantification of gene expression, was executed efficiently in a serverless environment. By leveraging the Life Sciences API, the computational demands of the pipeline were seamlessly managed on Google Cloud, eliminating the need for local resource management. The tutorial highlighted the key steps involved in preparing data (copying FASTQ files, reference genomes, and configuration files to a Google Cloud Storage bucket), setting up the execution environment (installing necessary software), configuring Snakemake for cloud execution, and finally running the workflow using the Life Sciences API. The results, including the top 10 most highly expressed genes in both wild-type and double lysogen samples, and the expression levels of a specific gene of interest (BB28_RS16545), were successfully retrieved and presented. This approach showcases a scalable and reproducible method for RNA-Seq analysis, particularly beneficial for large-scale genomics projects.  Future work could involve expanding this workflow to incorporate more sophisticated downstream analyses and integrating additional data types."
