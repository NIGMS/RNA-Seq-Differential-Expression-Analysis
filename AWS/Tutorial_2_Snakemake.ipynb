    "This short tutorial demonstrates how to run an RNA-Seq workflow using a prokaryotic data set. Steps in the workflow include read trimming, read QC, read mapping, and counting mapped reads per gene to quantitate gene expression. This tutorial uses a popular workflow manager called 'snakemake'. More information on snakemake can be found <a href=\"https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">here</a>. Running the code in this tutorial will take approximately 12 minutes.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understanding Snakemake configuration:** Learners will examine Snakemake configuration files (YAML) and understand their role in defining the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Running a Snakemake workflow:** Participants will execute a pre-written Snakemake workflow for RNA-Seq analysis, encompassing steps like read trimming, quality control, mapping, and read counting.  They learn to interpret and utilize a Snakefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interpreting RNA-Seq results:**  Learners will learn how to access and interpret the output of the Snakemake workflow, including identifying highly expressed genes and examining the expression levels of specific genes of interest.  This involves using command-line tools like `sort`, `head`, and `grep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Navigating a modular workflow:** The notebook introduces the concept of modularity in bioinformatics analysis by showcasing additional related notebooks (workflows)  covering different aspects of RNA-Seq analysis (e.g., extended tutorials, differential gene expression analysis using R).  This emphasizes the organization and scalability of workflows."

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook performs RNA-Seq analysis using Snakemake, relying on several external tools and data sources. Here's a breakdown of the prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "**APIs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **aws s3:**  The Amazon S3 Storag tool `aws s3` is used extensively to download data from an Amazon S3 bucket.  This implicitly requires the Amazon S3 API to be enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Software and Dependencies:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Snakemake:** This workflow manager orchestrates the entire RNA-Seq pipeline.\n",
    "* **Bioconda Channels:** The notebook uses bioconda channels to install bioinformatic tools.\n",
    "* **Other tools (installed via bioconda):** The Snakemake workflow uses multiple bioinformatic tools (like Trimmomatic and Salmon) that will be installed through the specified conda environments. The notebook doesn't explicitly list all the tools used within the Snakemake workflow. This is specified within the `envs/*.yaml` files.\n",
    "* **Sufficient disk space:** The workflow requires sufficient space to store the downloaded data, intermediate files, and results. The amount of space will depend on the size of the datasets processed.\n",
    "* **Multiple CPU cores:** The notebook uses multiple cores (`--cores $CORES`) to speed up the analysis with snakemake. The number of cores utilized is determined by `nproc`.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook provided a comprehensive demonstration of RNA-Seq data analysis using Snakemake, a powerful workflow management system.  The tutorial efficiently processed a prokaryotic RNA-Seq dataset, covering key steps from read trimming and quality control using Trimmomatic and FastQC to read mapping and quantification of gene expression with Salmon.  The use of Snakemake streamlined the workflow, enabling reproducible and manageable execution of the entire pipeline.  The notebook successfully generated gene expression counts, allowing for downstream analyses like identifying differentially expressed genes (as shown by examples in the notebook) and further exploration using provided links to additional notebooks, including a DEG analysis workflow (Tutorial 3) and an extended version of the current Snakemake workflow focusing on scalability and broader data handling. This tutorial serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing RNA-Seq analysis using a robust and reproducible approach.  The clear instructions and readily available supplementary materials make it easily adaptable for both novice and experienced users."
